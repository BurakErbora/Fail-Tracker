#Project Description
Fail Tracker is an ASP.NET MVC 5 reference application that shows how investing in an application framework can greatly simplify day-to-day development activities, improve testability, and reduce development friction.  It was used to demonstrate various techniques used in my Pluralsight course on building application frameworks: http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/build-application-framework-aspdotnet-mvc-5

#What's an Application Framework?
That's a great question.  In a nutshell, an application framework is a strongly-opinionated set of conventions, helpers, and infrastructure that is designed to remove headaches an uninteresting concerns from day-to-day development.  This topic was discussed in-depth on my Pluralsight course: http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/build-application-framework-aspdotnet-mvc-5.

#What's the goal of this project?
Fail Tracker is meant to serve as a reference application for those wishing to simplify ASP.NET MVC development.
