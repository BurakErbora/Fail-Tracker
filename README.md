#Project Description
Fail Tracker - a collaboration tool for distributed agile software teams.  It's also a best-practices ASP.NET MVC 3 reference application that shows how investing in an application framework can greatly simplify day-to-day development activities, improve testability, and reduce development friction.

#What's an Application Framework?
That's a great question.  In a nutshell, an application framework is a strongly-opinionated set of conventions, helpers, and infrastructure that is designed to remove headaches an uninteresting concerns from day-to-day development.  This topic was discussed in-depth during a 2-hour session at CodeStock this year.  The video from this session will be available online soon.  In the meantime, please refer to http://trycatchfail.com for more information.

#What's the goal of this project?
Fail Tracker has two goals: to serve as a reference application for those wishing to simplify ASP.NET MVC development, and to provide a great open-source platform for agile collaboration.  A hosted instance of Fail Tracker will be available during the second half of 2011.
